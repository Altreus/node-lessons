  Lesson 1 is all about data. Ultimately, everything in your application needs
  data. Data represent individual packets of information about a thing; and the
  thing the information is about is determined by the purpose of your program.

  Data are the simplest elements of the application. There are two basic types
  of data: strings and numbers. Every datum ultimately comes from either a human
  or a piece of sensory equipment, or is the result of modifying a datum that
  did. You're probably a human, so let's begin.

  First we'll input your name. Your name is a string because it's not a number.
  Even if your name is Seven, that's a string; a string is a sequence of
  characters.

  To input your name, surround it with quotes. In Javascript you can use either
  single quotes (') or double quotes (") but they have to match.
